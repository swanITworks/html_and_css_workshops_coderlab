#Workshops 1/6

This repository was created by me as a task at the end of the first module at Coderlab It school.
The first module concerns the basics of JS HTML CSS.
The task required creating a website according to the template in the module1workShops.jpg file.
The task didn't require RWD and Links functionality.
